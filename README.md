# COVID Vaccination Progress 
A3 Project members: Abdellah, Chithra, Eric, Jennifer, and Jessica

### Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 vaccination progress across nine counties in California. To conduct our analysis, we used publicly avaiable csv files from the CDC and California Health Department. We focused on California to narrow the parameters of our analysis. 

### Hypothesis 
We hypothesize the vaccination and death rates would vary demographically. 

Due to historical scientific experiments in communities with high populations of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) (such as Tuskegee Syphilis Study, forced sterilization of Mexican women by Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center hospital), members of these communities will have lower vaccination rates. We believe that the White, non-Hispanic demographic will have the highest vaccination rate. 


### Analysis Questions 
1. What is the correlation between COVID cases and COVID related deaths?
2. How does vaccination rate affect the case/death rate?
3. Which demographics have the highest vaccination rate in California? 
 

### Observations

There is a positive correlation between COVID cases and COVID-related deaths.
- Of the 1.4% of positive COVID tests resulted in deaths in California. 
- The outliers represent the counties where there were no deaths.
